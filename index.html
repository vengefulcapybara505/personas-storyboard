            <h1><br> Walmart Self-Checkout Personas and Storyboard <br><br></h1>
            <p class="intro-p">
                For this project, I had to pick an interface in a public place and analyze user interactions with it. I then
                had to conduct interviews with the various users and ask them questions about their experience.
                Using the data collected, I then came up with personas with characteristics I believe best fit the consumers.
                Using one of the personas, I then created a storyboard that showcases some of the issues with the interface. This
                gives us practice on analyzing existing interfaces and conducting user research to find the pros and cons of a particular
                design.
                <br><br>
                I chose the self-checkout station at Walmart for my interface because 
                I have had personal difficulty using their interface before that extends further than just the software. 
                The Walmart self-check checkout has two lower platforms for items on either side of the scanner. 
                It allows for payment using cash and credit cards, but no contactless payments. It has a big touchscreen that shows the items paid for and bill total. 
                Users pull up their cart or their basket and scan items on the scanner placing them 
                onto the adjacent platform for bagging - the user can either bag while scanning or after payment. 
                After scanning all the items, the user proceeds with payment and takes their items. 
                The interface is trying to make it easy for a user to checkout. It needs to be easily learnable and efficient.</p>

                What is a storyboard?<br>
                A storyboard is a visual representation of a user's interaction with a product. 
                It depicts a product that is similar to a film in terms of how people would utilize it. For this instance
                it would show how a Sean uses the self-checkout to scan his items and pay and any issues he has in doing so.
                The storyboard is meant to incorporate characteristics of the persona. <br><br>

                This project taught me how to observe users and pay close attention user interactions with an interface.
                I also learned valuable interview skills and how to phrase open-ended questions that reduce my preconvieved
                biases. It was fun to take my user observations and morph them into personas that have their own fictional story.
                I had done storyboards in elementary school and this reminded me of making a comic book; it was really cool to see
                that these are used professionally and verified my marginal artistic talent. <br><br><br><br>
