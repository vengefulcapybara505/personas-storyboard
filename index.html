            <h1>Walmart Self-Checkout Personas and Storyboard</h1>
            <p class="intro-p">I chose the self-checkout station at Walmart because 
                I have had personal difficulty using their interface before that extends further than just the software. 
                The Walmart self-check checkout has two lower platforms for items on either side of the scanner. 
                It allows for payment using cash and credit cards, but no contactless payments. It has a big touchscreen that shows the items paid for and bill total. 
                Users pull up their cart or their basket and scan items on the scanner placing them 
                onto the adjacent platform for bagging - the user can either bag while scanning or after payment. 
                After scanning all the items, the user proceeds with payment and takes their items. 
                The interface is trying to make it easy for a user to checkout. It needs to be easily learnable and efficient.</p>
                
                <p>
                    Here is my sketch of the self-checkout kiosk:
